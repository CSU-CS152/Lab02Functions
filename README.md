# Lab 02 - Methods and Objects
## Introduction
After completing all of the following methods, you will be expected to test each of the methods. These tests will be performed using the commented lines within your **main** method.

This lab only has one file that you will modify, **Pizza.py**, but three files are included to allow you to test and run the pizza ordering application.

Within the **Pizza.py**, there are 4 variables that are associated with each "Pizza" object. Throughout this lab our "Pizza" object will have it's variables modified to yield the correct output.
