# Lab 02 - Functions
## Introduction
This lab introduces the idea of functions. Functions are self-contained parts of code meant for you to use over and over again instead of writing the same code multiple times. In this lab you will be asked to write a total of five functions. The first four functions will calculate the area of circle, rectangle, triangle, and trapezoid, respectively. The last function will print a statement about the shape given the type of shape and it's area passed in as arguments.

## Pre-Step: Application Flow

### Testing
An important aspect of programming includes testing your code to check for errors. A great way to test your program for this lab is to create function calls from your main method, print the returned value, and verify that the returned value is what you would expect it to be. 

## Step 1: Area of a Circle
The area of a circle is $\Pi$ * $radius^2$. $\Pi$ is declared as the variable PI and is initialized to 3.14 on the first line of code in this program. The circleArea function takes in only one parameter--the radius of that specific circle. It returns the area of that circle. 

## Step 2: Area of a Rectangle
A rectangle's area is length * width. Both length and width are passed into the function rectangleArea as parameters. The function returns the result of multiplying those two parameters. 

## Step 3: Area of a Triangle

## Step 4: Area of a Trapezoid

## Step 5: Print Shape Information
